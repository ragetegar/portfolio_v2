Hi, I’m Tegar, a frontend developer with a deep love for visual design, music, and creative projects that mix art and technology. I’ve spent the past decade building digital experiences, from microsites and motion banners to full-scale web platforms. I’m happiest when something I build not only works but also feels clean layouts, smooth animations, and small details that make users smile.

Outside of code, I’m someone who finds inspiration in sound and storytelling. Whether it’s composing dreamy electronic music, exploring new game ideas, or simply tinkering with design concepts, I’m always chasing that spark where creativity meets emotion. This blog is where I’ll share thoughts, experiments, and pieces of my journey both the polished and the messy parts. Welcome aboard.
